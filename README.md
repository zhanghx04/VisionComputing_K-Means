# UI Explain

For the layout of GUI on the left top section:
  - the number of culster K (range: [2, 99999])
  - timer (duration between iterations, range: [100, 10000] ms)
  - sample per cluster (Only for when randomly generate data, range: [10, 1000])

Second section on top, the dimension can be chose by 2 or 3. The distance method and Centroid initialiing method have fixed choices.

For the rest of part on top, point size and center size could be changed by user. If user want to generate data from files, first need to check "Data From File", then, choose the txt file name. Once the "Data from File" checkbox is enabled, the data will not be generated by random. The choices of text file could be:

The center part is the ViewWidget which displays the process of the project. For the first block at bottom, once the K-Means is done, user can click "Speed and Energy button" to display the value. If user wants to step thru each iteration, the "Go Each Step" checkbox should be enabled, and choose the number of iteration. The digital display box shows the current iteration. The [Previous] and [Next] button will be disabled when step to end-iterations.
    
The right half side of bottom operation area is controlling the view. User can zoom in, zoom out, or go back to original position. The buttons [ << ] and [ >> ] allow user to rotate the view by \{0.5, 1.0, 0.5\}. The Up, Down, Left, Right, and Center buttons control the position of **The eye**.
